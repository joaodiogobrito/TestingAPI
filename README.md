# TestingAPI

This repository contains the different kind of tools I used to test APIs.

- Poastman  - a simple project I created composed by 2 collections of 4 requests each collection
            - API for testing: http://numbersApi.com
            - it uses environment and global variables
            - each of the requests of the nonRandom collection has four test cases: status code, headers, body content and response time
